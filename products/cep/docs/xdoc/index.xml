<h1>Welcome to WSO2 Complex Event Processor (CEP) v1.0.0 </h1>

<p>WSO2 Complex Event Processor (WSO2 CEP) is to be your Complex Event
Processing System (CEPS). Our ultimate goal is to provide you with the suitable 
capability of filtering events and generating new events according to your
 organization's decisions. </p>

<p>CEP 1.0.0 supports applying your organization' decisions on receiving event
streams and generating new events on matching events.
<p>WSO2 CEP 1.0.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary <a
href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">Carbon platform</a>
, and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the better modularity for
your Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). This also contains a lots of new
features and many other optional components to customize the behavior of the
server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in features, you can
uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, CEP can be
customized to your SOA needs. </p>

href="http://wso2.org/downloads/CEP">Project Download Page </a> and give it a
try. </p>
