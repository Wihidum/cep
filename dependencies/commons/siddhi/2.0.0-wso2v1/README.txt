Siddhi CEP is a lightweight, easy-to-use Open Source Complex Event Processing
Engine (CEP) under  Apache Software License v2.0. Siddhi CEP processes
events which are triggered by various event sources and notifies appropriate complex events
according to the user specified queries.

This project was started as a research project initiated at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka,
and now being improved by WSO2 Inc.

Note: This release is NOT compatible with older versions, and its a complete revamp.
 This release can be tested end to end.
